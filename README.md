# ‎‧₊˚✩ FOGGY CITY TYPE GENERATOR ✩˚₊‧

## Description
Foggy City Type Generator is an OpenGL program written by Tiffany Huang and Elijah Whang, inspired by Kiel D.M.'s web-based Space Type Generator (https://www.instagram.com/kiel.d.m, https://spacetypegenerator.com/). It incorporates real-time rendering with primitive-based city generation, Phong lighting calculations, Perlin noise fog generation, and type libraries to allow users to write messages as seeds for foggy cities. Users can adjust parameters by changing the sliders, checkboxes, text boxes, dropdown menus, and number inputs to tweak their scene; the app also supports mouse and key (W, A, S, D, space, and control/command) interactions to rotate the text and move around the scene respectively. Supported parameters include rendered string, typeface, building height range, building irregularity, horizontal and vertical street density, fog density, fog height, and the option to display fog in solid or particle modes.
